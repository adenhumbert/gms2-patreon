The project provides a framework within GameMaker Studio 2 for allowing Patreon creators to request access to membership information from their patrons using a basic php/mysql server setup. This project is not intended to be a production ready plug-and-play solution, but to provided a starting point that can be built on and customized by others. This is functional, but by no means complete or ready for use in a production environment. The server code, especially, needs additional security measures.
